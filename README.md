# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## OVERVIEW

The purpose of this analysis is to take a list of 34,000 foundations and use neural network machine learning in order to predict where the best investment opporunities would be.


## RESULTS

### Data Processing
- The variable being used is tracking whether or not the foundation is successful.
- The features of this data set are the foundations application type, affiliation, classification, use case, organization, status, income amt, special considerations, and their asking amount.
- For this machine learning model, the EIN ID # and the name of the foundations have been removed.
